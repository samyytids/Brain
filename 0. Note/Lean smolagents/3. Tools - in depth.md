# What is a tool and how to build one.
They are "mostly" a function that the LLM can use in an agentic sense.
But to use it the LLM needs to know the name, tool description, input types and descriptions and output type. 
"So it cannot be only a function"...
Except it can because you told me it can. 

However they suggest using classes as wrappers (I assume that's what the @tool wrapper does?)

```python
from smolagents import Tool

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    name = "model_download_counter"
    description = """
    This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.
    It returns the name of the checkpoint."""
    inputs = {
        "task": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "the task category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc)",
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, task: str):
        from huggingface_hub import list_models

        model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
        return model.id

model_downloads_tool = HFModelDownloadsTool()
```

The typing in this case need to be pydantic formats. 

The idea here is that the @tool decorator is used for simple tools and the Tool subclass is for more complex tools.
