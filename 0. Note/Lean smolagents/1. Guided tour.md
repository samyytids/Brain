## The bare minimum
- Model- the text generation model you want to power your agent. 
	- TansformersModel (something you can run locally, just a pipeline)
	- HfApiModel basically any inference model on hugging face
	- LiteLLMModel Same as HfApi but through LiteLLM
	- AzureOpenAIServerModel - OpenAi models deployed through Azure
	- MLXModel- MLX-LM pipeline to run inference locally
- tools- a list of tools that the agent can use. You can also make use of some baseline tools by setting add_base_tools=True

## `CodeAgent`
A code agent is simply an agent that executes python code snippets at each step with the goal of achieving some task. 

After running you can inspect what was done by printing `agent.logs()` or `agent.write_memory_to_messages()`

## Tools 
This is an atomic function that an agent can use. It requires the following so that it can be used by an LLM.
- Description
- Name
- Input types and descriptions
- Output type

Tools can be called manually using its arguments. 
### Default tools
- DuckDuckGo web search
- Python interpreter (for running LLM generated code)
- Transcriber (Speed to text pipeline)

### Creating a tool
```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models
task = "text-classification"
most_downloaded_models = next(
	iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1))
)
```

Above is some simple code for grabbing the most downloaded model for a given task.
This can easily be converted into a tool by doing the following:
```python
from smolagents import tool 

@tool
def model_download_tool(task: str) -> str:
	"""
	This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the 
	Hugging Face Hub. It returns the name of the checkpoint. 
	
	Args:
		task: The task for which to get the download count.
	"""
	most_downloaded_model = next(
		iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downlaods", direction=-1))
	)
	return most_downloaded_model.id
```

#### Pre-flight checks
- A clear name, basically make the name of the function descriptive of what the function does. 
- Type hint everything. 
- A description that includes the args, this needs to describe each argument
### Using a custom tool
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[model_download_tool], model=HfApiModel())
agent.run(
    "Can you give me the name of the model that has the most downloads in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?"
)
```

## Multi-agent systems
Each agent needs a name and description, these are then embedded into the manager agent's system prompt. 
### Example
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool

model = HfApiModel()

web_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],
    model=model,
    name="web_search",
    description="Runs web searches for you. Give it your query as an argument."
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[], model=model, managed_agents=[web_agent]
)

manager_agent.run("Who is the CEO of Hugging Face?")
```
