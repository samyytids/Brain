# Shoot for simplicity
The more freedom an LLM has the more likely you are to experience errors.
This doesn't mean that you isolate an LLM to have 1 small task, more so that you reduce the number of tasks the LLM has to manage. IE take 7 small functions ran by the LLM and turn them into 1 monolith function that returns the final result of the 7 functions. 
This is both good for costs as well as latency. 
In general decisions should be made deterministically rather than being made by the agent.

## tldr;
- Make the decisions based on rules, not the output of the LLM. 
- Multi-agents do better. 
- Combine steps into single functions. Think a main() tool that wraps all the steps needed.
- Make sure the task is very clear. 
- Each tool should log (print) anything that is useful for the LLM engine. Tool execution errors especially.

# Additional context
You can supply additional arguments to the LLM beyond describing the task in order to give the LLM things to use while performing your task. 

# Just use a better LLM forehead
Well, if your LLM is performing badly just use a more expensive LLM!
