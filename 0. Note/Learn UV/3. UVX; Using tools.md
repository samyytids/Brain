# UVX
UVX invokes a tool without installing it. 
`uvx ruff`
This is an alias of 
`uv tool run ruff`

## Passing arguments
`uvx cowsay hello from uv`

## Running tools that have different names
`uvx --from httpie http`
by default uvx runs the package with the same name as a the tool. eg uvx ruff runs the ruff package from the ruff tool. If the tool and package don't have the same name use --from.
## Running a specific version
`uvx ruff@version`
`uvx ruff@latest`
`uvx --from 'ruff==0.3.0'`

## Running with extras
`uvx --from 'mypy[faster-cache, reports] mypy --xml-report mypy_report'

# UV
If I use a tool a lot it makes sense to install it so that you don't have to keep invoking uvx. 
`uv tool install ruff`

## Upgrading tools
`uv tool upgrade ruff`
