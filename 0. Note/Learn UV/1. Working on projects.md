# Creating a new project
```bash
uv init project-name
uv init # to start in working dir
```
This will create the following files. 
```bash
.
├── .python-version # Tin
├── README.md # Tin
├── main.py # Hello world 
└── pyproject.toml # Python dependencies
```
You can run the main.py using `uv run main.py`

# Project structure
```bash
.
├── .venv
│   ├── bin
│   ├── lib
│   └── pyvenv.cfg
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```
### pyproject.toml
This contains meta data about your project, kinda like cargo.toml
```toml
[project]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
dependencies = []
```

## .python-version
This literally just contains the python version.

## .venv
Your venv.

## uv.lock
Cross platform file that contains exact information about your project. Think of this as being the super exact version of the pyproject.toml that can be used to replicate your project. 

# Managing dependencies
## Adding dependencies
```bash
uv add requests
uv add 'requests==2.31.0'
uv add git+https://github.com/psf/requests
```

## Removing dependences
```bash
uv remove requests
```

## Updating dependencies
```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```
This will do its darnedest to update the package(s) listed. 

# Running commands
`uv run` is the arbiter of most things. You can use it to run scripts or commands. 
```bash
uv add flask
uv run -- flask run -p 3000
# Or as we saw earlier you can run a script
uv run example.py
```

## Running more directly (through venv)
If you want to just run things manually (without using uv run)
```bash
uv sync # Updates your venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Enter venv
flask run -p 3000 # command
python example.py # script
```
