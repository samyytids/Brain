# General notes
- Page 5: increasing numbers of new properites are being built or remodelled to be green
- Page 6: Builders motivations seem to mostly be social rather than profit/demand driven.
- Page 7: Reasons for not doing it seems to be costs and lack of demand.
- Page 8: Focus seems to be on general energy efficiency and environmental quality rather than more specific goals like water and resource efficiency. 

# Reason for stopping
Not really useful for my context, but could be useful for some general points?
