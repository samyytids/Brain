# Nushell commands output data
The basic meaning behind this is that bash just outputs formatted strings while nu outputs what is efectively a CSV. 

# Acting on data
Instead of passing arguments or switches to a command like `ls` to sort the data we instead pass the output of ls to other nushell commands. 
```nushell
ls | sort-by size | reverse
```
The above takes the output of ls, sorts it by size and then reverses the order. 

## Filtering data using where
This works in much the same way as using the `sort-by` buitlin. 
```nushell
ls | where size > 10kb
```
Note: nushell is a typed shell, which has a filesize type so it knows how to order filesizes with different tiers of size.
