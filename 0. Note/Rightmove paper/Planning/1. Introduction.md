# Introduction
Third party intermediaries are an essential part of many industries, some industries necessitate them, others they provide a service that simply eases frictions and in others they can be seen as unnecessary middle men. Regardless of which of these three scenarios is the truth for any given industry, it is often the case that these third parties are usually compensated for their expertise in the form of a percentage based commission. In real estate markets  fees charged in the US are relatively high (5-6%) and stable across home value and time (Hsieh and Moretti, 2003) this taken into consideration with the fact that 90% of house sales are aided by an estate agent in the US along with in the US in 2021 the median percentage of an individuals net worth that was represented by home equity was 45% (https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/12/04/the-assets-households-own-and-the-debts-they-carry/) the 5-6% fee equates to 2.25-2.7% of an individuals net worth.

Given the substantial cost relative to personal wealth that is present in the real estate market it is especially important to ensure that an estate agent's services are providing sufficient value for said fee. In exchange for their fee estate agents provide a number of vital services such as aiding with the preparation, pricing and marketing of the property. Beyond the explicit services that are provided estate agents also possess a number of attractive attributes. Such as, superior knowledge of the market as shown by their ability to secure lower prices when purchasing their own homes (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19301229) while also selling their own homes at a premium (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X05000218). However, this also highlights potential agent issues where the incentive is not necessarily to achieve the best value for the client but to gain as much commission as possible while also selling the properties quickly, (https://www.jstor.org/stable/40043103) finds that agents not only sell their own homes for a premium but that they also stay on the market for longer. 

So far we have established that estate agents are both ubiquitous as well as relatively expensive and that they benefit from informational asymmetries. As such it is incredibly important that prospective clients are able to assess the performance of an estate agent. In this paper we investigate whether there is a performance delta between estate agents as well as what aspects of their listing strategy drive said performance. We make use of detailed information from active online property listings in the United Kingdom (UK) from January 2024 to July 2024. 
We then benchmark agent performance against 3 main metrics, price, time to subject to contract (STC) and price reduction percentage.

With these measures of agent performance we can answer a number of questions: First, what aspects of property listings drive this performance? Second, does proficiency in one area lead to proficiency in the others or do agents specialise? Third, what agent characteristics drive performance? Finally, what property characteristics are sought out by more skilled agents?

We begin by estimating a standard hedonic model on price, time to STC windows and price reduction percentage. To assess real estate agent performance we include agent (office) level fixed effects, these are based on the agent ids provided on each property listing these ids are static between different properties listed by the same office. Similar methodologies have been implemented when assessing the value of teachers, managers, and investment banks in mergers and acquisitions (Aaronson et al., 2007; Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Bao and Edmans, 2011). These fixed effects are interpreted as explaining time-invariant and agent specific factors that explain average sales price, time to STC and price reduction percentage over and above the property characteristics and detailed geographic controls included in the specifications.

\[Insert a section on the FE distributions and interquartile range, I can't figure out how they calculate theirs so my results are uninterpretable I guess?]

Having found significant variability in agent performance we now seek to identify drivers of agent performance, previous elements of the literature have suggested a trade off between high selling speed and high selling prices (see Anglin et al., 2003; Glower et al., 1998; Krainer, 2001; Munneke et al., 2015; Shen and Springer, 2022). We find that there is a significant trade off between an agent's ability to sell quickly or sell for a high price. We also find a significant relationship showing that agents that are adept at selling quickly are also more likely to reduce the listing price of their properties. These results highlight that agents appear to specialise for one outcome at the expense of another. 

Another potential avenue that agents can pursue in order to gain an edge is their marketing strategy along with the contents of their product listings. We find that superior performance in terms of sales speed is negatively associated with making use of featured listings and the resolution of their images while being positively associated with the number of images posted on the listing. Suggesting a potential quantity over quality approach. Whereas superior performance in terms of securing higher prices is positively associated with making use of both featured and premium listings as well as being positively associated with the average resolution of the images posted on the listing. While being negatively associated with the length of the description as well as the number of images, possibly suggesting a more quality over quantity approach to the information supplied on their listings. 

We also examine how agents are rewarded based on their performance, we find that agents who excel at selling properties quickly experience reduced market share overall unless they excel at selling properties extremely quickly (STC within 30 days) then under some forms of market share we see as positive association. Meanwhile those that excel in terms of selling properties for high prices see increases in market share for all metrics regardless for which price measure is used. We also find that those that reduce their prices by the largest amount also experience reduced market share. 

Next we implement a test to examine how the property pools of each agent differ, to do so we examine diamonds in the rough. This being when a dummy variable that highlights whether a property is located in a postcode with a higher average home value than the outcode that postcode is within (outcode being the first half of the postcode). In this we find that agents that excel at selling properties quickly are have a lower probability that their properties exist in one of these diamond areas as do agents that reduce their property values by larger amounts. We find the opposite is the case for agents that are proficient at selling their properties for higher values. This may suggest some sort of different strategy where agents that are better at achieving high valuations for their properties are more likely to target areas with high value properties while those specialising in speed do the opposite. 

Finally we look at splitting the sample based on the top 10 percent and bottom 10 percent of performers in each category (I have the results I just don't know how good they are)
## What does the literature currently say?
## What questions do I intend to answer?
- Do agents actually offer significant performance improvements?
- We should also consider what aspects that are within the agents control drive that performance so you can more easily make decisions regarding which agents you want to hire. 
	- Talk about the different elements that you have data on, you'd want to know how you can assess from an agents current listings what is likely to be a predictor of good performance. 
- Are agents that are good at one thing inherently good at another? Is there a trade off?
## What methodology am I using?
- Hedon
- FE stuff
- Splits/Dummies
## Brief summary of results.
This bit is easy.
