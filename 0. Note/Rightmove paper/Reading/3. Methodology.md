Explain how each experiment answers each question.
- "If agents add value to the home buying and selling
	process through superior negotiation skills then we should expect to find evidence that they
	are proficient at securing a high price when representing a seller as the listing agent and good
	at securing a low price when representing a buyer. Thus, we take a subsample of agents who
	work on both the sell and buy side of the market and estimate the correlation between the
	distribution of listing agent price fixed effects and buyer agent price fixed effects"
