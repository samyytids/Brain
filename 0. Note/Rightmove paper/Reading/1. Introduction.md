# To Do
- [ ] Summary of literature (steal references?)
- [ ] Outline the domain and why it's important.
- [ ] What we are intending to answer.
- [ ] Methodology and cover potential issues.
- [ ] Results summary (I don't have much to say here)

- [ ] More tests to actually have stuff to write about
I need to sit and look at the data I have and things I can look into in order to explain performance and vice versa.

## Introduction
### MetaData
- 6 Pages, including footers (which I won't be using?)

### Summary
#### Page 1
Third party agents are used in numerous areas of finance/business. Think lawyers, investment bankers and executive search.
Real estate agents are the most commonly used type of agent.
This makes them especially important as house sales are often the most important transaction for the average person. 
Do they offer value?
Commissions are high, are they worth it?
Anti trust suit raises concerns regarding collusion.
Undeniable they offer a service.

#### Page 2
Undeniable that estate agents provide numerous services.
Previously there has been more information asymmetry between sellers/buyers and agents.
Reduced with data becoming public.
Agents have (hopefully) got a skill/experience advantage over the general public.
Typical agency issues. 
What they are using as a performance measure. 
What percentage of agents can warrant their fees. 

#### Page 3
Outline of the questions they are intending to answer. 
- What fraction of listings generate enough value to warrant the fees charged?
- Does high performance persist temporally?
- Are good agents rewarded with more business?
- Do agents perform well as both buyers and sellers (buy low sell high)?
- Do they do their best work in hot or cold markets (large sales volumes and price increases)?
Outline of what kind of methodology they use and how it is made possible via their dataset. 
Highlight places where similar methodologies are used. 
Explain what FEs show, agent individual factors that explain performance.

#### Page 4
Address some concerns that may be had with the methodology, basically FEs.
Very brief summary of main results (including values).
- We find X% increase in Y based on Z.

#### Page 5
More about various tests they have done. 
Look at other potential results such as looking at explaining why superior performance is achieved. 
Find little evidence that agents focus on speed over price.

#### Page 6
More stuff about their tests and results.
