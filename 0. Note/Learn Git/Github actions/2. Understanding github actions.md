# The building blocks
Everything starts with an `event`. An event here is anything you do with your repo using git. For example [[7. Git remote#`push`|git push]] or [[7. Git remote#`pull`| git pull]]. 
When an `event` is triggered you can run a series of `jobs` in sequential order or in parallel. These jobs will run in their own VM or container. Workflows can also run other workflows which means you don't have to spend ages re-writing the same stuff over and over. 

## Events
You can run these either automatically based on some git activity, just on a schedule or by posting to an API. 

## Jobs
These are a set of steps of a workflow that are executed by the same `runner`. These jobs are either a shell script or another action that will be run. These steps are sequential and dependent. Jobs however by default have no dependencies and are executed in parallel unless otherwise configured. 

## Actions
These are custom applications for the github actions platform that perform complex but frequently repeated tasks. 

## Runners
A runner is a server that runs your workflows. Each runner can run a single job at a time. These can either be self hosted or hosted by github themselves.
