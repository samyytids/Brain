# What is an action?
This is part of CI/CD. This allows for automating the build, test and deployment pipeline. These allow for doing useful things such as running tests when you push code or deploying any merged pull requests into production.

# Creating workflows
These are all done on github, not using git on your local repo. They also make use of the `.yml` format. Your workflows all go in the `.github/workflows` directory.
Below is an example workflow.
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions 🚀
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
This seems to mostly just be about showing off syntax and name spacing.
