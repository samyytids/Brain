# Specifying rust version
The [[2. Understanding github actions#Runners|runners]] hosted by github by default have a recent version of the rust toolchain so you can make use of things like `rustup` to specify what rust version you want to be using for your action.

```yml
- name: Temporarily modify the rust toolchain version
run: rustup override set nightly
- name: Output rust version for educational purposes
run: rustup --version
```

# Caching dependencies
```yml
- name: Cache
- uses: actions/cache@v4
with:
  path: |
	~/.cargo/registry
	~/.cargo/git
	target
  key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

# Building and testing the code
Essentially you do exactly as you would do when building and testing your project locally. 
```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        BUILD_TARGET: [release] # refers to a cargo profile
    outputs:
      release_built: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.release_built }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build binaries in "${{ matrix.BUILD_TARGET }}" mode
        run: cargo build --profile ${{ matrix.BUILD_TARGET }}
      - name: Run tests in "${{ matrix.BUILD_TARGET }}" mode
        run: cargo test --profile ${{ matrix.BUILD_TARGET }}
```
I need to learn a bit more about yml, but this seems to effectively just be namespacing some variables and then running some very basic cargo commands. 

# Building and releasing your project
This releases your project on crates.io.
This makes use of secrets to log into crates.io, which makes sense. Don't want my username and password on my github.
```yml
- name: Login into crates.io
	run: cargo login ${{ secrets.CRATES_IO }}
- name: Build binaries in "release" mode
	run: cargo build -r
- name: "Package for crates.io"
	run: cargo package # publishes a package as a tarball
- name: "Publish to crates.io"
	run: cargo publish # publishes your crate as a library that can be added as a dependency
```
