## Guh, please stop editing my code!
The process seems to be essentially identical to merge conflicts. But the ours and theirs part is swapped because a `rebase` is moving the history of our branch to being on the end of the main branch. 

However, there's another key difference. We do not commit our way out of `rebase` conflicts we `--continue` our way out of them.

### Steps to fix `rebase` conflicts.
- `rebase`
- Find conflicts
- Update your code. `add` changes but do NOT `commit`. 
- `rebase --continue`
- `log` to check if everything is as it should be.
