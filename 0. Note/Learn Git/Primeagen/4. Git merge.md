## Merging is based 
Merging is done when you want to re-add your branch into the main codebase. 

## Some terms
- Merge base: The most recent common ancestor of two branches. 
## Merge commits
These are used to merge two branches with differing histories. 
```
A -- B -- C -- E
 \
  D -- E -- F
```
Say I want to merge F in to main now. We can see that there are commits between the head of the current branch and the point it was branched off at. 
To create a merge commit we first need to find the earliest common ancestor we then need to patch together the two branches so they agree.

### Example
```bash
git init
git add . 
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git switch -c branch
git add . 
git commit -m "Branch commit"
git switch main
git merge branch
```

## Fast-forward merge
This is the simplest type of merge. 
If your branch is not behind the main in anyway, IE it contains all the commits of the main branch then we can simply use a fast-forward merge. This effectively just puts the branch as the head of the main branch. 

This doesn't require a specific command it is still done using `git merge branch_name`.
