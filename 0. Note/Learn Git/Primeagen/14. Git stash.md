## I'll save that for later. 
Say you have some amount of work that you have started on, it's been staged. But not committed yet. Then you need to start working on something else or someone has pushed to the main branch and you "need" to pull it down. 
You can stash your staged changes and then pull down the changes then re-apply your stashed changes so that you can keep working on the updated code base. Or simply store you changes while you work on something else. 

This can be a simpler alternative to committing, pulling, updating code, committing and then squashing.

## Checking what is in your stash.
After using `git stash` you can check that everything you expect to be in your stash is there by using `git stash --list`.

## Re-applying your stashed content
`git stash pop` this applies your most recent stash entry to your working directory and removes it from your stash list. 

### Alternatives
#### `apply`
This works like pop but doesn't remove it from the stash.
#### `drop`
This removes things from the stash but doesn't apply them.
