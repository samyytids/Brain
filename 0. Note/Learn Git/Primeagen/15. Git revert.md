## What's the difference?
Where `reset` slams its dick on the table and takes you back a whole commit `revert` is much more intentional on what gets changed. Here we instead of undoing a commit we make a new commit that is the exact opposite of the previous commit. 

## Why would I do this?
If I am on my own independent branch I can reset to my hearts content. But if I am on a shared branch then it is probably best that I use revert as this maintains the history of the repo.
