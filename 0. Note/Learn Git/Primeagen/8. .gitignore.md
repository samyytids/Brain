## LALALALALALALA
Used for ignoring things that you don't want in your repo. 
Or specifically allow a series of files. 
This can be applied to directories as well as files. 

## Extra tid bit
If you want to have something only applied locally you can add it to your git/exclude. That way you can ignore stuff that is specific to you without having to "pollute" the `.gitignore` file in your project. 

## Example
```.gitignore
*.json
*.rs
example/
out/
ligma -- This would apply to files or directories that are called ligma.
/main.py -- only main.pys in the same directory as the .gitignore.
```

## Nesting
You can have multiple `.gitignore`s, each `.gitignore` will only apply to files below it in the file tree. 
```tree
|--- example
|	|
|	|- .gitignore
|
|- .gitignore
```
The first `.gitignore` will only apply to all the files/directories above it while the one in example will only apply to stuff within the example directory.
