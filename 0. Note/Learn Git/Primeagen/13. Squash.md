## I never liked history anyway
Squashing is the process of turning a series of commits into a single commit. 
This is handled through the `rebase` command. 

## Steps
- `git rebase -i HEAD~n` 
	- where `n` is the number of commits we want to squash.
	- where `-i` denotes an interactive `rebase`. 
- We then change the label to `squash` for all but the commit we want to squash until which we label as `pick`.
