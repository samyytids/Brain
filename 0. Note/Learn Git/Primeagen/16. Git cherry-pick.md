## Non-committal commits
I have a series of commits in a branch, I don't want them all. Some of the commits aren't properly tested while the other is a simple bug fix. I want to add the bug fix to the main branch but not the experimental stuff. 
This is where `git cherry-pick` comes in. 

## Workflow
- A clean working tree (everything needs to be committed)
- find the commit I want to cherry pick.
- `git cherry-pick <HASH>`
