## Oh God you changed something I changed. 
If a line of a file has been edited in 2 branches we will have conflicts. We will need to tell git which one of these two lines we want to keep. 
`git status` can be used to identify where conflicts are. 
`git merge --abort` can be used to abort a merge that is causing conflicts. 

## How to solve?
Well you basically have to open all the files in your text editor and choose one of three options. 
- Accept our code (top option)
- Accept their code (bottom option)
- Both (keep both options) 
We then `add` and `commit` the changes. 

## Commit messages
Since this is a conflict that you manually solved, git can't provide a default message. As such you should provide a merge commit message that highlights what you did and why.
