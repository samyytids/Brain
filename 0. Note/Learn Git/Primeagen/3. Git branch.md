## What is a branch anyway?
These are useful for making small changes to your project while experimenting without needing to "commit" to changing the main branch. 

## branch
`branch` can be used to find which branch you are currently on. 

### `-m`
This is used to rename a branch.
`git branch -m oldname newname`

### `-d`
This is used to delete a branch.

### Making a new branch 
`git branch new_branch`
or
`git checkout -b new_branch` <- old
or
`git switch -c new_branch` <- new

### Switching branches
This can be used to move to existing branches. 
In general you want to use switch over checkout. 
`git switch different_branch`
or 
`git checkout different_branch`
