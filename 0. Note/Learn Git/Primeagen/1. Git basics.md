## Features of a repo
### .git
This is the directory that basically contains all the information about your git repo. 

### .gitignore
This is a list of patterns that will be ignored when you add things to your repo. Eg. I don't want to include any .env or .json files. 

## Git basics  
### Starting your repo
`git init`
There really isn't much more to say about this. 

### Status
A file can be in 1 of three stages. 
- `untracked` Git cares not.
	- If you delete these files, they are gone for good.
- `staged` Will be included in the next commit.
- `comittied` Saved to the repos history.

You can view the status of your files and folders by using `git status`.

### Add
This is used to add untracked files to the stage. 
`git add filename.txt`
`git add .` 
`add .` can be a bit dangerous, as it will add everything in the repo and sometimes that's just not something that you want to do. 
## Commit 
This is used to commit your staged changes to the history of your repo. 
`git commit -m "Some information about the commit"`

### `--amend`
This can be used to amend an unpushed commit with content of a new commit.

### log
This shows the history of your commits, when they were comitted and who did it.
