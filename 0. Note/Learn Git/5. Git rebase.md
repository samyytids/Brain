## Even more based then merging
Re-basing instead of merging two branches together it takes your current branch and sticks it on the end the of the other branch. 
```bash
A -- B -- C
 \
   D -- E
----------------------
A -- B -- C 
           \
             D -- E
```

This allows for you to get a fast-forward merge rather than a merge commit. 

This is done by using the command `git rebase branch_to_base_on`.
Conflicts will occur when you have files that are changed in the base branch and the branched branch. 

## Why rebase?
Rebasing keeps your history nice and linear, which makes it easier to read and easier to perform reverts with. 

## WARNING.
DO NOT DO THIS WITH PUBLIC BRANCHES LIKE MAIN. Basically this is why you end up with awful shit. Eg if I have a branch that I created locally and I branched off of that branch, I can use rebase with impunity as it will not effect anyone else. 
But if I did this on main I would be a dick and would cause a headache for everyone involved.
