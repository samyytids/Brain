## Yaaaaaa
This can effectively be used to rewind time. 
This can be done at a variety of levels. 

### `--soft`
This is useful if you want to go back to the beginning of the commit without changing your code. 
I suppose this could be useful for updating the contents of a previous commit rather than creating a whole new commit. For example those times where I have forgotten to comment out 1 line of code. 

### --hard
This unlike `--soft` will completely undo any code changes that I have made since the commit that I have rest to. 

#### WARNING
You can easily lose important code if it has not been committed at any point.

### If you can't be bothered to fetch a hash
`git reset --soft HEAD~1`
This will soft reset to 1 commit before the point that you are at in your current branch.
