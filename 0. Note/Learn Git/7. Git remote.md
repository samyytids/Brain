## Shared work
Github is just a remote version of our repo that we use as a central source of truth for multiple developers to work on the same project. 

## `fetch`
`fetch` is used to grab information from a remote repo. 
`fetch` just gets the commits it doesn't actually do anything to bring the code onto our system it just fetches the .git contents. 

## `pull`
`pull` actually grabs all of the files from the remote repo. 

## `clone`
`clone` is used to clone the contents of a repo.
## `push`
`push` takes the contents of our local repo and pushes them onto the remote version.
