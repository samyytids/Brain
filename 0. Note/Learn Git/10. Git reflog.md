## Why is this different to log?
This tracks not only the commits but also how we got to places. The main use that is mentioned for this is saving yourself when you have beansed yourself. 

## Un-beansing
So, you accidentally deleted a branch.
What do you do?
You can use git reflog to see the creation of that deleted branch. 
A simple way to do this is to use `reflog` to find the hash of a commit you lost, and then merge it back in using said hash. 
You can also use `git cat-file`  to cat the contents of files from inside the lost commit if you just want to recover a single file.
