## Finding bugs, with binary search. 
You need 2 pieces of information for `bisect`. A commit hash that doesn't have the bug and a commit hash that does have the bug. 

## Workflow
- `git bisect start`
- `git bisect good <HASH>`
- `git bisect bad <HASH>`
- Check if the commit that I am shown is good.
- `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`
- Rinse repeat until we get to `git bisect good`
- `git bisect reset` This will reset us back to the point where the bug didn't exist. 

You can also automate this process with a simple bash script that does some grepping.
