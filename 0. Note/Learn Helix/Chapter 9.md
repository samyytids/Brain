# Searching for selections
/ stores the most recent search in the / register
\* can be used to copy a selection into the / register
This achieves the same effect as /y

# Using sections to generate cursors
v can be used while searching in place of n to add the next example of the search term to your selection which is easier than using C to set up multiple cursors.

# Jumping around
Ctrl + s saves your current cursor location into the jump list.
Ctrl + i jumps forward
Ctrl + o jumps backwards

# Jump with 2 character labels
gw enables 2 character labels (not sure what that means yet)
2 character labels let you jump to any location in the viewable selection.
tldr, hit this and then type in the greyed out characters that are where you want to jump to and you can jump there.
