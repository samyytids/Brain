# Undoing
u undoes whatever you just did

# Copy and paste
y copies
p pastes after the cursor
P pastes before the cursor
You can use space + p and space + y to use the system clipboard
By default helix uses its own clipboard.
Also [[Chapter 3 Motions and selections#Selecting words|selecting]] and [[0. Note/Learn Helix/Chapter 1#Delete at cursor|deleting]] will copy the text to the clipboard, you can avoid this by using alt + d and alt + whatever.

# Searching
/ finds things based on the text you provide
? finds things, but backwards (top to bottom I assume)
n to go to the next search 
N to go to the previous search 
You can also use regexes if you wanna be a smarty pants
