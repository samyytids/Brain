# Cycling and removing selections
Say you have a series of selections of the word would, but you want to deselect one of them that does not need to be changed. 
You can achieve this using:
) and ( let you change which selection is your primary selection.
Alt + , then let you remove the primary selection from your selection.

# Cycling content of selections
Alt + ( or ) allow you to "rotate" the content of your selections
- I ==am== an ==example==, no ==seriously==
- I ==example== an ==seriously==, no ==am==

# Changing case
~ switch the case of selected characters to the other case
\` all selected characters to lower case
Alt + \` all selected characters to upper case

# Splitting selections
S splits a selection based on a regex, so whatever parts of your text match that regex will not be included in the selection.
